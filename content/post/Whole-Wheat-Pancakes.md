## Ingredients
-	3/4 cup (100 grams) all-purpose flour
-	2 tablespoons stevia or brown sugar
-	1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-	1 tablespoon baking powder
-	3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
-	1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups (295 to 350 ml) reduced fat milk, dairy or non-dairy
-	1 large egg
-	4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for skillet or substitute coconut oil
-	1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract


## Instructions
1. Whisk flours, stevia, cinnamon, baking powder and the salt in a medium bowl, set aside. Warm the milk until lukewarm, not hot (you should be able to keep your finger submerged for 10 seconds). Whisk milk, butter, egg and the vanilla together until blended.
2. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour milk mixture into the well and stir with a fork until mixed and only small clumps of flour remain. Do not over mix batter. Note: The batter will be quite thick. If it is unreasonably thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more milk to thin it out a little. Your wholemeal pancake batter is ready!
