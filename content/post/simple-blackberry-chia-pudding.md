## Ingredients
-	1 Tbsp chia seeds
-	1 Tbsp plain yoghurt
-	2 Tbsp blackberries
-	0.25 tsp maple syrup
-	a tiny splash of vanilla extract

## Instructions
1. Place the chia seeds, yoghurt, milk, maple syrup, blackberries, and vanilla into a jar (for the large batch I find a one-liter wide-mouth mason jar works perfectly) and stir well.
2. Let the mixture stand on the counter top for about 10 minutes, then stir again to break up any clumps.
3. Screw a lid onto the jar, and place into the refrigerator overnight, or for at least 3 hours.
4. When you're ready to serve, stir the chia pudding, spoon into bowls, and add any desired toppings.
