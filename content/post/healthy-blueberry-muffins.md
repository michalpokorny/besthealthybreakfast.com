## Ingredients
-	1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon white whole wheat flour, divided
-	1/2 cup lightly packed light brown sugar
-	1 tablespoon baking powder
-	1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-	1/2 teaspoon salt
-	1 cup plus 2 tablespoons nonfat milk
-	1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
-	2 large eggs (at room temperature)
-	2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
-	1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries (do not thaw if frozen)


## Instructions
1. Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 400 degrees F (200C). Lightly coat a standard muffin tin with nonstick spray, then coat the liners with nonstick spray. Set aside.
2. In a large mixing bowl, stir together 1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour, rolled oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, butter, eggs, and vanilla. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, add the wet ingredients to the well, then carefully stir with a wooden spoon, just until blended.
3. Gently toss the blueberries with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour, then fold them into the batter, discarding any excess flour that doesnâ€™t stick to the blueberries. (This will prevent the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the muffins.)
4. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven, and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.
